# Red Wine Quality Prediction

This application is designed to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data). The primary goal of this application is to provide wine enthusiasts, producers, and industry professionals with a quick and easy way to assess the quality of red wine samples.

## Usage

1. **Running the App**: To use the Red Wine Quality Prediction App, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run Prediction.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in the default web browser.


2. **Using the App**: After launching the app, the Red Wine Quality Prediction App interface will appear. Follow the instructions on the screen to input the chemical properties of the red wine.

    - Navigate through the input fields and enter the values for each chemical property of the wine.
    - Once all inputs are filled, click the "Predict!" button to see the quality prediction of the red wine.

4. **Interpreting Results**: The app will display the predicted quality of the red wine based on the input values. The prediction is given as a quality category, helping to understand the potential quality of the wine. 

5. **Feedback and Improvements**: We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvements. Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or opening issues on the project's GitHub page.
